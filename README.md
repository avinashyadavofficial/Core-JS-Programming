#  Core JS Programming

Welcome to the **Core JS Programming** sprint!  
This sprint focuses on mastering JavaScript fundamentals and essential Git skills. You'll learn how to write efficient JS code, use modern syntax, and collaborate using Git in real-world projects.

---

##  Sprint Goals

By the end of this sprint, you will be able to:

- Use JavaScript for basic logic, data manipulation, and control flow
- Work with numbers, strings, arrays, and key data structures
- Apply array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more
- Use modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and destructuring
- Understand `var` vs `let` vs `const`
- Manage source code using Git and collaborate using branches and PRs

---

##  Topics Covered

###  JavaScript Programming

####  REPL & Basic Constructs
- Using Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions

####  Numbers & Strings
- Working with numeric and string methods
- Parsing and formatting numbers
- String operations and template literals

####  Arrays & Array Methods
- Array creation and manipulation
- Common methods: `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`

####  Arrow Functions
- Shorter syntax for cleaner function expressions

####  Iterables & Data Collections
- `Map` and `Set` for key-value and unique collections
- `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` for memory-safe object associations

#### Destructuring Assignment
- Extracting values from arrays and objects into variables

#### Variable Declarations
- Differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Scope, hoisting, and best practices

---

###  Git Programming

#### Branching & Merging
- Creating and switching branches
- Merging changes and managing different features

#### Commits & Messages
- Making atomic commits with meaningful messages

####  Conflict Resolution
- Detecting and fixing merge conflicts

#### Git Bash as Client Tool
- Using Git Bash for command-line Git operations

---

##  Tools & Setup

- Node.js (for REPL and JS execution)
- Git & Git Bash
- VS Code or your preferred editor
- Optional: GitHub for remote repo collaboration

---

##  Expected Outcomes

- Write clean and modern JavaScript code
- Solve common problems using arrays and functions
- Work with JS collections like `Map` and `Set`
- Confidently use Git for source control in teams
- Understand the collaborative PR and merge workflow
